# Memory Model – Examples

This project contains runnable examples that demonstrate
how the C# memory model behaves at runtime.

Each file focuses on one concept only.

Rules:
- Read the code slowly
- Predict the output before running
- Trace stack vs heap mentally
- Do not modify examples until instructed

These examples exist to prove the theory, not replace it.
