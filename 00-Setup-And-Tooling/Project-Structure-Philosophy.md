# Project Structure Philosophy

This repository is structured to support:
- Long-term learning
- Clear topic isolation
- Interview preparation
- Production-level reasoning

## Design Rules

- One concept per folder
- Theory before code
- Practice after theory
- Interview notes are explicit
- No mixed responsibilities

## Why This Matters

Clear structure:
- Improves comprehension
- Encourages focused learning
- Mirrors real-world codebases

This structure is intentional and non-negotiable.
