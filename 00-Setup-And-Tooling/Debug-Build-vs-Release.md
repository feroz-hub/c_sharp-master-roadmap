# Debug vs Release Builds

## Debug Build
- Includes debugging symbols
- Less optimization
- Easier to step through code

## Release Build
- Optimized by JIT
- Faster execution
- Harder to debug

## Why This Matters

- Performance issues often appear only in Release
- Production runs in Release
- Developers must understand build differences
