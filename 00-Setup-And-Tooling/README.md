This section ensures that the development environment, tooling, and workflow
used throughout this repository are consistent, modern, and production-grade.

Before writing or studying any C# code, the following must be understood:
- How .NET projects are created and structured
- How the .NET CLI works
- How builds and debugging differ
- How Git is used professionally

This section is intentionally completed before any language fundamentals.
