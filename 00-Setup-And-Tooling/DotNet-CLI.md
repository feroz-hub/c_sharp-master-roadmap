# .NET CLI Essentials

The .NET CLI is the primary way to:
- Create projects
- Build applications
- Run applications
- Manage dependencies

## Common Commands

- `dotnet new`
- `dotnet build`
- `dotnet run`
- `dotnet test`
- `dotnet restore`
- `dotnet clean`

## Why CLI Knowledge Matters

- CI/CD pipelines rely on CLI
- Servers do not use IDE buttons
- Interviews often expect CLI familiarity

IDE actions are wrappers around CLI commands.
